He prolific career began in the 1990s, where she cut her teeth on Academy Award winning films such as Good Will Hunting and Shakespeare in Love. This year, Deborah helped cast Weas Anderson's tour-de-force The Grand Budapest Hotel, already the recipient of several post-season awards. Perhaps the greatest indicator of Deborah's value is the fact that renowned Hollywood directors such as Tim Burton, Wes Anderson, and M. Night Shyamalan have repeatedly partnered with her, proving that her relentless work ethic and keen eye for talent on projects from micro-budget independent films to major studio blockbusters have made her a highly sought-after commodity in the film industry."
